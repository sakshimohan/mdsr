# Cleaning Maternal Death Surveillance Report Data (MDSR) for Malawi

MDSR Excel files are currently in excel formats which are not easy to analyse. This is an attempt at writing a generalisable code to parse
through the excel files to generate a clean dataset. Certain inputs need to be provided for the function to work properly - row in which data begins, column in which data begins, number of districts.
